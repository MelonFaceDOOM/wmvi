# Other time vars to consider:
# OnUnitActiveSec -- wait this long after the script STARTS before
#    trying to start it a second time.
#    If the first still running after this time,
#    2nd will start as soon as 1st finishes
#    (alternative to OnUnitInactiveSec)

# Initial delay after boot before first run

# Delay after the service unit becomes inactive (i.e., after it finishes)

# If a run should have occurred, but didn't
#    auto-schedule one to occur immediatel after next boot.
# I think should be false every time?

# reduce simultaneous wakeups / add jitter since there are many timers
