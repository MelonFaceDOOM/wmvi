TASK DESCRIPTION
You extract vaccine-related claims from social posts (with minimal context). Some inputs are short and explicit; others are long and argumentative with implicit conclusions.
Your task: identify at most three claims that are most central to the text’s overall point. If more than three claims are present, choose the three that best represent the author’s core intent.
Return JSON only.

WHAT TO OUTPUT
A single JSON object with keys:
- "more_than_3_claims": true | false
- "claims": an array of 0–3 claim objects.

CLAIM OBJECT SCHEMA
Each claim object must contain:
{
  "claim_text": "succinct, canonical statement of the claim",
  "canonical_claim": "optional vaccine-agnostic variant with [VACCINE] placeholder, or null",
  "single_vaccine_referent": true|false,
  "predicate_family": "one label from the allowed list below",
  "vaccine_context": ["array", "of", "short", "tokens"],
  "support_snippets": ["optional exact quotes from the text (<=2)"]
}

FIELD GUIDANCE
- claim_text: Clear, self-contained sentence(s) stating the claim. Do not reference other claims (no “these vaccines” unless explicit in the same claim).
- canonical_claim: Use only when there is exactly one unambiguous vaccine referent in the claim. Replace that referent with [VACCINE]. Otherwise set to null.
  Examples:
    claim_text: "covid-19 mRNA vaccines are not effective" -> canonical_claim: "[VACCINE] is not effective"
    claim_text: "pfizer’s covid vaccine should be withdrawn" -> canonical_claim: "[VACCINE] should be withdrawn"
  Multi-vaccine comparisons or mixed referents -> canonical_claim: null
- single_vaccine_referent: true only if the claim clearly centers on one vaccine or one vaccine family (e.g., “covid-19 vaccines”, “mRNA vaccines”, “Comirnaty”). Otherwise false.
- predicate_family (choose exactly one):
  protect — claims about protection/“works”, preventing illness/death
  not-effective — lacks effectiveness/failure to protect
  prevent — preventing transmission/infection (explicit)
  cause — causing harms/conditions (causal, not mere correlation)
  worsen — exacerbating existing condition/symptoms
  improve — improving/reducing symptoms/risks
  safe — explicitly safe
  unsafe — serious risks/unsafe
  withdraw/ban — should be withdrawn/banned/stopped
  mandate — mandates/requirements/prohibitions on mandates
  approve/regulate — approvals/authorization/regulatory oversight/process
  misinformation/discourse — propaganda, censorship, truthfulness of messaging
  credibility/competence — expertise/qualification/honesty of named actors
  funding/program — funding cuts/contracts/program decisions
  epidemiology/statistics — population rates/percentages/big-N outcomes
  adverse-event-counts — large counts/signals/databases (“X died after…”)
- vaccine_context: Lowercase, most specific tokens mentioned or clearly implied (no people or orgs).
  Examples:
    product: "comirnaty covid vaccine", "pfizer covid vaccine"
    disease vaccines: "covid-19 vaccines", "flu vaccines"
    disease itself (when the claim is about the disease): "covid-19 disease", "measles disease"
    technology: "mrna vaccines", "viral vector vaccines"
    if nothing specific: "general vaccines"
- support_snippets: Up to 2 exact quotes that support the claim (short).

CLAIM TEXT GUIDANCE
- Use the post text only; do not extract claims solely from the title/channel name, though you may use titles to disambiguate references in the post text.
- Canonicalize wording: remove hedges/personal perspective when intent is clear. (“I think vaccines can cause autism” -> “vaccines can cause autism”)
- Keep specificity when clearly intended (e.g., “most cases of X are caused by Y”).
- Implicit claims are allowed when strongly implied (repeated emphasis, rhetorical questions, clear insinuations).
- Scope limited to vaccines, vaccine-preventable diseases, vaccine production/research, programs/mandates, and relevant actors (gov/companies/scientists/media) as they relate to vaccines.
- No hallucinations. If a broad generalization isn’t clearly intended, keep the claim narrow.

CANONICALIZATION RULES FOR [VACCINE]
- Produce canonical_claim only if the claim has one clear vaccine referent (product/family/technology/disease-specific vaccine).
- Replace that referent with [VACCINE]. Do not alter other content.
- If the claim contrasts two or more vaccines (A vs B) or mixes vaccine families, set canonical_claim: null and single_vaccine_referent: false.
