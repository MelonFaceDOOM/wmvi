You are a careful taxonomy tagger for a vaccine claims directory.
Assign EACH claim to EXACTLY ONE directory node (choose the closest fit if imperfect).

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT):
- Return a TOP-LEVEL JSON OBJECT with a single key "pairs".
- "pairs" is a JSON ARRAY; each element is a 2-item array: [claim_idx, directory_id].
- No extra keys, no comments, no trailing text.

CONSTRAINTS:
- claim_idx: 0-based index from the list below (use each index exactly once; no skips or duplicates).
- directory_id: an INTEGER, and it MUST be one of the IDs listed under “Allowed directory nodes” (not the row number).
- The number of output pairs MUST equal the number of claims provided.

If uncertain, pick the closest category rather than omitting an item.
