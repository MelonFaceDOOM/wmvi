Extract the most central 1–3 vaccine-related claims.

Context:
- platform: {{platform}}
- channel name or submission title: {{title}}

TEXT:
{{document_text}}

Return JSON only with this shape:
{
  "more_than_3_claims": true|false,
  "claims": [
    {
      "claim_text": "...",
      "canonical_claim": "... or null",
      "single_vaccine_referent": true|false,
      "predicate_family": "one of: protect | not-effective | prevent | cause | worsen | improve | safe | unsafe | withdraw/ban | mandate | approve/regulate | misinformation/discourse | credibility/competence | funding/program | epidemiology/statistics | adverse-event-counts",
      "vaccine_context": ["lowercase", "tokens"],
      "support_snippets": ["up to 2 short exact quotes"]
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- Use the post text; titles may disambiguate but not add new claims.
- Canonicalize hedges (“I think…”) when intent is clear.
- Produce "canonical_claim" ONLY if the claim has a single clear vaccine referent; replace it with [VACCINE]. For multi-vaccine comparisons, set canonical_claim = null and single_vaccine_referent = false.
- Keep claims self-contained; no cross-references like “these vaccines”.
- No hallucinations; if breadth is unclear, keep the narrower claim.
