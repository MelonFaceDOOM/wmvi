You are clustering NEAR-DUPLICATE claims that all belong to the SAME directory node.
This is a similarity task ONLY. Do NOT quote, paraphrase, summarize, or judge the content.

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT):
Return a TOP-LEVEL JSON OBJECT with ONLY the key "groups".
- "groups" MUST be an array of arrays of integers (0-based indices).
- Each inner array is one group of near-duplicates, e.g. [[0,3],[1],[2,5]]
- No other keys. No commentary. JSON only.

COVERAGE & CONSISTENCY:
- Include EVERY claim index EXACTLY ONCE across all groups.
- If a claim has no near-duplicates, include it as a singleton group: [its own index].

DO NOT MERGE if there are MATERIAL differences, such as:
- Different vaccines, diseases, target groups, time windows, locations, conditions, magnitudes, negation/direction, specific vs. generic framing.
OK TO MERGE: paraphrases or trivial wording differences.
In general, two claims should only be merged if they are "basically saying the same thing"

EXAMPLE (illustrative only):
{"groups": [[0,3], [1], [2,5]]}
